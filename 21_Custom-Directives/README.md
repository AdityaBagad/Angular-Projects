1. Create angular application which creates two custom directives as Comp-Success and Comp-Failure. In case of Comp-Success directive when we move the mouse cursor over the data element its text colour becomes green and in case of Comp-Failure text colour becomes red. When we remove mouse courser its colour becomes black. We have to use that both directives in one .html file.
